    'so, a single flower among the rocks. The harshness of the stone makes '

    'cities did. Put a foot wrong with one, and the next ten you met knew of '
    'it, and disapproved.',
    '"Not the whole world," he replied. But if they can see, they can hear as '
    'well. You have made a place in my heart where I thought there was no '
